# React Error Boundaries
These are components that catch errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and show them in an alternate interface instead of the broken component tree. A class component becomes an error boundary if it defines one or both lifecycle methods. This repository demonstrates a basic example of using these special components.
